# snakey-snake

Just a snake game. Play it @ https://tanialx.github.io/snakey-snake/

This project is where I play around with `<canvas>`, do various drawing, or experiment with some JavaScript or CSS behaviors. Any new implementation is created out of a whim and just for fun, so the game can sometimes become silly.

### Game rule

- Move snake with 4 arrow keys.
- ~~Game-over if snake hits 4 walls (top, left, bottom, right) -> This rule is boring, should be removed soon~~ If snake goes outside canvas, it's gonna come back from the opposite wall
- Snake gains length and speed after eating `fruits`
- Snake gains weight after eating `donuts`; when it reaches its adult tile's size, weight gain slows down significantly
