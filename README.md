Just a snake game. Play it @ https://tanialx.github.io/snakey-snake/

This project is where I play around with `<canvas>`, do various drawing, or experiment with some JavaScript or CSS behaviors. Any new implementation is created out of a whim and just for fun, so the game can sometimes become silly.

### Game rule

- Move snake with 4 arrow keys; pause/resume with SPACE
- If snake goes outside canvas, snake makes a U-turn and comeback from the same wall
- Snake gains length and speed after eating `fruits`
- Snake gains weight after eating `donuts`. The fatter the snake is, the longer it takes for the snake to gain real weight
